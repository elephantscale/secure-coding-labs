* However, it comes with two warning shown below. Therefore, this is an instruction on running the labs securely.

* __WARNING 1__: While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program. WebGoatâ€™s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize the exposure.

* __WARNING 2:__ This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you. Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the first thing that all hackers claim.
